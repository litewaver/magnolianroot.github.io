my first personal project - website coded from scratch: first developed with HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, 
added JS functionality and libraries like Popper.js for dynamics, now utilizing Twitter's oEmbed API for mobile/social integration,
wrapped in modern UI/UX principles and practices for a 2024 interfaced-feel.
